Pivot selection can significantly impact quicksort's performance, particularly in reducing the chance of encountering worst-case scenarios. Here are some common methods:

### Median-of-Three

This method picks three elements—typically the first, middle, and last elements of the array—and chooses the median value among them as the pivot. This approach is simple to implement and often leads to a more balanced partitioning. The idea is that by taking the median of these three, you are likely to avoid a very low or very high pivot, which can lead to unbalanced partitions.

``` c
int median_of_three(int* arr, int low, int high) {     int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;     if (arr[low] > arr[mid])         swap(arr, low, mid);     if (arr[low] > arr[high])         swap(arr, low, high);     if (arr[mid] > arr[high])         swap(arr, mid, high);     return arr[mid]; }`

### Randomized Pivot

Choosing a pivot randomly helps avoid the worst-case performance that can occur with already sorted or nearly sorted data. This method selects an index uniformly at random between the current low and high indices, then swaps it with the first or middle element before partitioning.

`int random_pivot(int* arr, int low, int high) {     int pivotIndex = low + rand() % (high - low + 1);     swap(arr, low, pivotIndex);  // Move pivot to the beginning     return arr[low]; }`

### Tukey's Ninther

This technique is a more advanced version of the median-of-three. It divides the array into three sections, takes three elements from each section (usually the first, middle, and last of each section), finds the median of each triplet, and finally takes the median of those three medians as the pivot. Tukey's ninther generally provides a better estimate of the true median, which can lead to more balanced partitions at the cost of some extra comparisons.

### Median-of-Medians (Deterministic Selection)

The median-of-medians algorithm guarantees a good pivot (with linear time complexity for finding an approximate median). It divides the array into groups (usually of five elements), finds the median of each group, and then recursively computes the median of these medians. While it provides theoretical guarantees on performance, the constant factors make it less attractive for practical implementations of quicksort.

### Summary

- **Median-of-Three** is widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in many scenarios.
- **Randomized Pivot** reduces the risk of worst-case performance by avoiding a fixed pivot position.
- **Tukey's Ninther** provides a more refined pivot selection by considering more elements.
- **Median-of-Medians** offers a worst-case guarantee but is typically too slow in practice compared to simpler methods.

Experimenting with these methods on your data can help you determine which one offers the best performance improvements for your specific case.
